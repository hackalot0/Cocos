>>	I was working on a class that represents members of a type.
	That type should be used within TypeInfo class.
	Finishing the class as it should support at least Properties and Fields for now.

- Add some smart reflection stuff
	- Add some type metadata resolving
		- Add classes to define some use cases for class members
		+ Add a class that manages types
			+ Add a class that manages members
				- Properties
				- Fields
				- Events
				- Constructors
				- Methods

- Add some smart networking stuff
	- The main entrance to networking is going to be the Peer
		- Every peer can have:
			- multiple subscriptions each representing a networking group
			- multiple services each representing a serving endpoint

	- Seperate the elementar things to allow a flexible app base for networking
		- Introduce behaviors
		+ Introduce adapters
		- Introduce channels
